        <h2>The destruction cause by AI</h2>
        <p>Experts say the rise of artificial intelligence will make most people better off over 
         the next decade, but many have concerns about how advances in AI will affect what it 
         means to be human, to be productive and to exercise free will</p>
          <div class="content">
             <p>A vehicle and person recognition system for use by law enforcement is demonstrated at last year’s
                  GPU Technology Conference in Washington, D.C., which highlights new uses for artificial intelligence 
                  and deep learning. (Saul Loeb/AFP/Getty Images)
                 Digital life is augmenting human capacities and disrupting eons-old human activities. 
                 Code-driven systems have spread to more than half of the world’s inhabitants in ambient information 
                 and connectivity, offering previously unimagined opportunities and unprecedented threats.
                  As emerging algorithm-driven artificial intelligence (AI) continues to spread, will people be
                   better off than they are today?
                 
                 Some 979 technology pioneers, innovators, developers, business and policy leaders,
                  researchers and activists answered this question in a canvassing of experts conducted 
                  in the summer of 2018.
                 
                 The experts predicted networked artificial intelligence will amplify human effectiveness 
                 but also threaten human autonomy, agency and capabilities. They spoke of the wide-ranging 
                 possibilities; that computers might match or even exceed human intelligence and capabilities
                  on tasks such as complex decision-making, reasoning and learning, sophisticated analytics 
                  and pattern recognition, visual acuity, speech recognition and language translation. They 
                  said “smart” systems in communities, in vehicles, in buildings and utilities, on farms and 
                  in business processes will save time, money and lives and offer opportunities for individuals 
                  to enjoy a more-customized future.
                 
                 Many focused their optimistic remarks on health care and the many possible applications of 
                 AI in diagnosing and treating patients or helping senior citizens live fuller and healthier
                  lives. They were also enthusiastic about AI’s role in contributing to broad public-health
                   programs built around massive amounts of data that may be captured in the coming years about
                    everything from personal genomes to nutrition. Additionally, a number of these experts predicted
                     that AI would abet long-anticipated changes in formal and informal education systems.
                 
                 Yet, most experts, regardless of whether they are optimistic or not, expressed concerns about the long-term
                  impact of these new tools on the essential elements of being human. All respondents in this non-scientific
                   canvassing were asked to elaborate on why they felt AI would leave people better off or not. Many shared
                    deep worries, and many also suggested pathways toward solutions. The main themes they sounded about threats 
                    and remedies are outlined in the accompanying table.</p>

             “machines that respond to stimulation consistent with traditional responses from humans, 
             given the human capacity for contemplation, judgment and intention.”3 According to researchers

         <p>AI is not a futuristic vision, but rather something that is here today and being integrated with and

                 depending on the speed of adoption.”8 Although its authors found that China currently lags the United 
                 States and the United Kingdom in AI deployment, the sheer size of its AI market gives that country

         <h2>Artificial intelligent slaves</h2>
         <p>These examples from a variety of sectors demonstrate how AI is transforming many walks of 
             human existence. The increasing penetration of AI and autonomous devices into many aspects 
             of life is altering basic operations and decisionmaking within organizations, and improving
              efficiency and response times.</p>
           <div class="content">
              <p>At the same time, though, these developments raise important policy, regulatory, and 
                 ethical issues. For example, how should we promote data access? How do we guard against
                  biased or unfair data used in algorithms? What types of ethical principles are introduced
                  
                  through software programming, and how transparent should designers be about their choices?
                   What about questions of legal liability in cases where algorithms cause harm?
                   The key to getting the most out of AI is having a “data-friendly ecosystem with unified standards 
                   and cross-platform sharing.” AI depends on data that can be analyzed in real time and brought
                    to bear on concrete problems. Having data that are “accessible for exploration” in the research
                     community is a prerequisite for successful AI development.

    <p>Although there is no uniformly agreed upon definition, AI generally is thought to refer to
