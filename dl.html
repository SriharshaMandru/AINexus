        <p> Deep learning is a method in artificial intelligence (AI) that teaches computers <br>
             to process data in a way that is inspired by the human brain. Deep learning models <br>
              can recognize complex patterns in pictures, text, sounds, and other data to produce <br>
               accurate insights and predictions. You can use deep learning methods to automate tasks <br>
                that typically require human intelligence, such as describing images or transcribing a <br>
                 sound file into text. </p>

        <h1>How does deep learning work?</h1>  <br>
        <p>Deep learning algorithms are neural networks that are modeled after the human brain. 
             For example, a human brain contains millions of interconnected neurons that work 
              together to learn and process information. Similarly, deep learning neural networks, 
               or artificial neural networks, are made of many layers of artificial neurons that work 
                together inside the computer.</p>

            <h1>Input Layer</h1>
            <p>The input layer passes the data directly to the first hidden layer where the data is multiplied by the first hidden layer's weights. <br>
                The input layer passes the data through the activation function before passing it on. The data is then multiplied by the first hidden <br>
                 layer's weights.
                The input layer has its own weights that multiply the incoming data. The input layer then passes the data through <br> the activation function before passing
                 it on. The data is then multiplied by the first hidden layer's weights.</p>
        </div>
        <br>
        <div class="layer2">
            <h1>Hidden Layer</h1>
            <p>The input layer processes and passes the data to layers further in the neural network. These hidden layers process information <br>
                 at different levels, adapting their behavior as they receive new information. Deep learning networks have hundreds of hidden <br>
                  layers that they can use to analyze a problem from several different angles.</p> 
                  <p>The hidden layers in deep neural networks work in the same way. If a deep learning algorithm is trying to classify an animal <br>
                     image, each of its hidden layers processes a different feature of the animal and tries to accurately categorize it.</p>

        <div class="layer3">
            <h1>Output Layer</h1>
            <p>The output layer consists of the nodes that output the data. Deep learning models that output "yes" or "no" answers have only two <br>
                 nodes in the output layer. On the other hand, those that output a wider range of answers have more nodes.</p>

            <h1>Deep learning in the context of machine learning</h1>
            <p>Deep learning is a subset of machine learning. Deep learning algorithms emerged in an attempt to make traditional machine learning techniques more
                 efficient. Traditional machine learning methods require significant human effort to train the software. For example, in animal image recognition.</p>

        <h1>Deep Learning Algorithms</h1>
        <p>Deep learning algorithms are dynamically made to run through several layers of neural networks, which are nothing but a set of decision-making networks <br>
             that are pre-trained to serve a task. Later, each of these is passed through simple layered representations and move on to the next layer. However, most <br>
              machine learning is trained to work fairly well on datasets that have to deal with hundreds of features or columns. For a data set to be structured or <br>
               unstructured, machine learning tends to fail mostly because they fail to recognize a simple image having a dimension of 800x1000 in RGB. It becomes <br>
                quite unfeasible for a traditional machine learning algorithm to handle such depths. This is where deep learning.</p>

            <h1> 2.Convolutional Neural Networks</h1>
            <p>Convolutional Neural Network or CNN is a classical artificial neural network model with a high potential for solving complex tasks and analyzing image and non-image data. It is based on the same principle as the arranged neurons in the cortex of the animal brain.</p>
            <p>CNNs are divided into four layers:</p>
            <p> 1.One input layer contains a two-dimensional arrangement of neurons for image content analysis.</p>
            <p>2.One-dimensional neuron output layer, while images are processed at the input nodes via convolutional layers.</p>
            <p>3.The third layer consists of hidden nodes and is known as the sampling layer, which determines the number of neurons involved in identifying the data content.</p>
            <p>4.Thus, CNNs can have one or more hidden layers between the input and output, connecting the sampling to the output layers.</p>
