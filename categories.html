        <p>Industrial artificial intelligence, or industrial AI, is the application of AI to industrial 
            use cases like the movement and storage of goods, supply chain management, advanced analytics,
           
            and automation and robotics in manufacturing.

            Industrial AI is often differentiated from other types of AI because itâ€™s more focused on 
            the application of AI technologies than in the development of human or human-like systems. 
            The datasets for industrial AI tend to be larger, but potentially lower in quality, than 
            those for general AI. Industrial AI also has zero-tolerance for false positives or negatives, 
            delayed insights, or unreliable predictions.
            Industrial AI is uniquely appropriate for process plants because the huge amount of data and
             quickly changing circumstances are too complex for manual or even digital management.</p>

        <div>
        <p>The ethics of artificial intelligence (AI) is an upcoming field of research that deals with
             the ethical assessment of emerging AI applications and addresses the new kinds of moral 
             questions that the advent of AI raises. The argument presented in this article is that,
              even though there exist different approaches and subfields within the ethics of AI, the
               field resembles a critical theory. Just like a critical theory, the ethics of AI aims to 
               diagnose as well as change society and is fundamentally concerned with human emancipation
                and empowerment. This is shown through a power analysis that defines the most commonly 
                addressed ethical principles and topics within the field of AI ethics as either to do
                 with relational power or with dispositional power. Moreover, it is concluded that 
                 recognizing AI ethics as a critical theory and borrowing insights from the tradition 
                 of critical theory can help the field forward.</p>

        <p>Artificial intelligence has enjoyed immense practical success in recent years, largely due
             to advances in machine learning, especially deep learning via optimization. Rich mathematical 
             theory explaining the many empirical results can help drive further advances, informed by 
             feedback from those advances.

            The latest results connect with celebrated techniques in learning theory, optimization, 
            signal processing, and statistics. The interplay between rigorous theory and engineering 
            advances pushes forward the frontiers of AI.
            Deep neural networks excel at learning the training data, but often provide incorrect and confident
             predictions when evaluated on slightly different test examples. This includes distribution shifts,
              outliers, and adversarial examples. To address these issues, we propose Manifold Mixup, a simple
               regularizer that encourages neural networks to predict less confidently on interpolations of hidden 
               representations.
