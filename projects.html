        <h1>1.Resume Parser AI Project</h1>
        <p>Recruiters spend a lot of time skimming through resumes to find the best candidate for a
             job position. Since there can be hundreds of applications for a single position, this
              process has been automated in several waysâ€Š- the most common is keyword matching.
               Resumes are shortlisted and read by the recruiters based on a set of keywords found 
               in a candidates resume. <br> <br>
             Otherwise,  the resume is discarded, and the candidate is rejected for the job. However,
              this screening process has many drawbacks. Candidates are aware of the keyword matching 
              algorithm, and many of them insert as many keywords as possible into their resumes to get shortlisted by the company.

            You can build a resume parser with the help of artificial intelligence and machine learning techniques that 
            can skim through a candidate’s application and identify skilled candidates, filtering out people who fill their resume with unnecessary keywords.
            
            You can use the Resume Dataset available on Kaggle to build this model. This dataset contains only two columnsâ€Š—â€Šjob title and the candidate’s resume information. <br> <br>
            
            The data is present in the form of text and needs to be pre-processed
            . You can use the NLTK Python library for this purpose. Then, you can build a clustering
             algorithm that groups closely related words and skills that a candidate should possess 
             in each domain. Words that are similar in context (and not just keywords) should be considered.
              You can assign a final weightage score to each resumeâ€Š—â€Šfrom 0 (least favourable) to 10 
              (most favourable). This is the most beginner-friendly project if you want to learn AI.</p>

    <div class="fake-news" id="sisi2">
        <h1>2. Fake News Detector Project in AI</h1>
        <p>Fake news is misleading or false information that is circulated as news. It is often difficult to distinguish between fake and real news, and it isn’t until the situation gets blown out of proportion that it comes to light. The spreading of fake news becomes especially dangerous during times like elections or pandemic situations.  <br>
           <br> Fake rumours and misinformation that pose harm to human lives are threatening to people and the society.
        Fake news needs to be detected and prevented early, before it causes panic and spreads to a large number of people.
        For this very interesting project, you will build a fake news detector, you can use the Real and Fake News dataset available on Kaggle.
       <br> <br> You can use a pre-trained machine learning model called BERT to perform this classification. BERT is a Natural Language Processing (NLP) model that has been made open-source. You can load BERT into Python and just add one additional output layer for your text classification task.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="pro" id="sisi3">
        <h1>3. Improved Detection of Elusive Polyps</h1>
        <p>This AI project showcases how Google leverages machine learning to assist gastroenterologists (GIs) in the fight against colorectal cancer by enhancing the efficiency of colonoscopies.</p>
        <img src="images/pro1" alt="">
        <p>The project aims to create a machine learning model that will aid the GI in detecting polyps in the area under observation, thereby overcoming the problem of incomplete detection. The developed CNN model relies on an architecture that integrates temporal logic with a single frame 
            detector to get more precise outcomes. This project involves working on two different Neural Network architectures- RetinaNet and  LSTM-SSD.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="insta" id="sisi4">
        <h1> 4. Instagram Spam Detection</h1>
        <p>Have you ever received a notification that someone commented on your Instagram post? You excitedly pick up your phone and open the app only to find that it’s a bot promoting some knockoff brand of shoes. The comment section of many Instagram posts is filled with bots.
             They can range from annoying to dangerous, depending on the type of call to action they require from you.You can build a spam detection model using AI techniques to identify the difference between spam and legitimate comments.

           <br> <br> You might not be able to find a dataset that has a collection of Instagram spam comments, but you can collect the data for this analysis by scraping the web. Access the Instagram API with Python to get unlabelled comments from Instagram.
            
            You can use a different set of data for training, like Kaggle’s YouTube spam collection dataset. Then, use keywords to classify words that commonly appear in spam comments.
            
            Use a technique like N-Gram to assign weightage to words that tend to appear in spam comments, then compare those words with each scraped comment from the web. Another approach you can take is the use of a distance-based algorithm like cosine similarity. <br>
            <br> These approaches will yield better results based on the type of pre-processing you apply.
            
            If you remove stop-words, whitespaces, punctuation and clean the data correctly, you will find that the algorithm performs better as it can match similar words with each other.
            
            You can also use a pre-trained model like ALBERT for better results. While distance or weightage matching algorithms work well in finding similar words, they are unable to grasp the context of a sentence.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="object" id="sisi5">
        <h1>5. Object Detection System </h1>
        <p>You can demonstrate skills in the field of computer vision with this project. An object <br>
             detection system can identify classes of objects present within an image by utilizing <br>
              computer vision techniques in the background. 

            For example, suppose an image <br> contains a picture of you working on a laptop. In that case, an object detection system <br>
             should be  able to identify and label you (human) and the computer, along with your <br> position in the image.
            
            You can use Kaggle’s Open Images Object Detection dataset <br> for this project. There is a pre-trained object detection model that has been made <br> open-source called SSD. This model was trained on a dataset of everyday objects <br> called COCO and can identify things like tables, chairs, and books.
            
            You can further <br> train the output layer of this model on the Kaggle Open Images dataset to build your <br> object detection system with high accuracy.</p>

            <div class="animal" id="sunny1">
                <h1>1.Animal Species Prediction</h1>
                <p>Another interesting computer vision project you can do is to predict an animal’s species based on an image.  You can do this with the Animals-10 dataset on Kaggle.
                     There are ten different categories of animals in this datasetâ€Š—â€Šdog, cat, horse, spider, butterfly, chicken, sheep, cow, squirrel, elephant. 
                    This is a multi-class classification problem, and you will need to predict the species of the animal based on its picture in the dataset.          
                    You can use a pre-trained model called VGG-16 for this purpose. You can load this model into Python with the Keras library.              
                    VGG-16 is a Convolution Neural Net (CNN) architecture trained on ImageNet, which contains over 14 million images. It consists of pictures of everyday objects, fruits, vehicles, and certain species of animals.
                              After loading the VGG-16 model into Python, you can train on top of it with the labelled images in the Kaggle dataset to classify the ten different types of animals.</p>

            <div class="machine" id="sunny2">
                <h1>2. Teachable Machine</h1>
                <p>If you are an AI enthusiast, you’ve probably heard about Google’s Teachable Machine. Teachable Machine is a web-based tool that was created to make machine learning accessible to everyone.
                    If you visit Google’s Teachable Machine site, they allow you to upload pictures of different classes and then train a client-side machine learning model on these pictures.</p>
                    <img src="images/pro3" alt="">
                    <p>An example of how Teachable Machine works:
                        There are two classes of images you need to upload. First, you upload around 100 pictures of yourself and label them as Class 1. Then, you upload another 100 photos of your cat and label it as Class 2.    
                        Then, you click on the “Train Model” button, and a client-side machine learning model will learn to distinguish between pictures of you and your cat.       You can then use this model to make new predictions on images.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="face" id="sunny3">
                <h1>3. Real-time Face Mask Detector</h1>
                <p>We have all been wearing masks for almost two years due to the Covid-19 outbreak. Many public places, including shopping malls, theatres, and restaurants, refuse to admit anyone who isn't wearing a mask.</p>

                <p>The goal of the research is to build a custom deep learning model to identify whether someone is wearing a mask or not. For creating the face mask detection model, use the face mask dataset available on Github. There are 1,376 photos in this collection, divided into two categories: with masks and without masks. In this project, you'll learn how to use Keras and TensorFlow to train a classifier that can automatically detect whether or not someone is wearing a mask. You can fine-tune the MobileNet V2 architecture using pre-trained ImageNet weights.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="fuel" id="sunny4">
                <h1>4. Fuel Efficiency Prediction</h1>
                <p>This project on artificial intelligence aims to forecast the outcome of a constant value, such as a price or a probability. Build a model that predicts vehicle fuel efficiency using the Auto MPG dataset, one of the most well-known datasets among machine learning practitioners. You need to give the model descriptions (including the number of cylinders, displacement, horsepower, weight, etc.) of various vehicles from a specific period. Using the Python pandas package, import the data. Make two sets of data: one for training and one for testing. Use the seaborn library's pairplot() method to visualize the data. Build your prediction model using the sequential API with two hidden layers and one output layer that will return a single value.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="plant" id="sunny5">
                <h1>5. Plant Disease Classifier</h1>
                <p>In this AI project, you will create an AI application that can detect plant illnesses by implementing a deep learning model. You will use the Pytorch framework and a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) architecture to implement the deep learning model.</p>
                <img src="images/pro5" alt="">
                <h3>Image Classifier for Plant Species Identification</h3>
                <p>Train the image classifier to distinguish the various plant diseases by looking at a picture. You can use this classifier to create a phone app that tells you what kind of disease your camera looks at. This project uses the "Plant Village" dataset that includes 38 plant disease classes and one background class from the open dataset of background images from Standford.</p>
