       <h2>Artificial Intelligence and the Future of Humans</h2>
       <p>Experts say the rise of artificial intelligence will make most people better off over 
        the next decade, but many have concerns about how advances in AI will affect what it 
        means to be human, to be productive and to exercise free will</p>

                 and deep learning. (Saul Loeb/AFP/Getty Images)
                Digital life is augmenting human capacities and disrupting eons-old human activities. 
                Code-driven systems have spread to more than half of the world’s inhabitants in ambient information 
                and connectivity, offering previously unimagined opportunities and unprecedented threats.
                 As emerging algorithm-driven artificial intelligence (AI) continues to spread, will people be
                  better off than they are today?
                
                Some 979 technology pioneers, innovators, developers, business and policy leaders,
                 researchers and activists answered this question in a canvassing of experts conducted 
                 in the summer of 2018.
                
                The experts predicted networked artificial intelligence will amplify human effectiveness 
                but also threaten human autonomy, agency and capabilities. They spoke of the wide-ranging 
                possibilities; that computers might match or even exceed human intelligence and capabilities
                 on tasks such as complex decision-making, reasoning and learning, sophisticated analytics 
                 and pattern recognition, visual acuity, speech recognition and language translation. They 
                 said “smart” systems in communities, in vehicles, in buildings and utilities, on farms and 
                 in business processes will save time, money and lives and offer opportunities for individuals 
                 to enjoy a more-customized future.
                
                Many focused their optimistic remarks on health care and the many possible applications of 
                AI in diagnosing and treating patients or helping senior citizens live fuller and healthier
                 lives. They were also enthusiastic about AI’s role in contributing to broad public-health
                  programs built around massive amounts of data that may be captured in the coming years about
                   everything from personal genomes to nutrition. Additionally, a number of these experts predicted
                    that AI would abet long-anticipated changes in formal and informal education systems.
                
                Yet, most experts, regardless of whether they are optimistic or not, expressed concerns about the long-term
                 impact of these new tools on the essential elements of being human. All respondents in this non-scientific
                  canvassing were asked to elaborate on why they felt AI would leave people better off or not. Many shared
                   deep worries, and many also suggested pathways toward solutions. The main themes they sounded about threats 
                   and remedies are outlined in the accompanying table.</p>

        <h2>Qualities of artificial intelligence</h2>
        <p>Although there is no uniformly agreed upon definition, AI generally is thought to refer to 
            “machines that respond to stimulation consistent with traditional responses from humans, 
            given the human capacity for contemplation, judgment and intention.”3 According to researchers
             Shubhendu and Vijay, these software systems “make decisions which normally require [a] human level 
             of expertise” and help people anticipate problems or deal with issues as they come up.4 As such, 
             they operate in an intentional, intelligent, and adaptive manner.</p>
          <div class="content">
             <p>Artificial intelligence algorithms are designed to make decisions, often using real-time data. 
                They are unlike passive machines that are capable only of mechanical or predetermined responses.
                 Using sensors, digital data, or remote inputs, they combine information from a variety of 
                 different sources, analyze the material instantly, and act on the insights derived from those 
                 data. With massive improvements in storage systems, processing speeds, and analytic techniques, 
                 they are capable of tremendous sophistication in analysis and decisionmaking.</p>

        <h2>Applications in diverse sectors</h2>
        <p>AI is not a futuristic vision, but rather something that is here today and being integrated with and 
            deployed into a variety of sectors. This includes fields such as finance, national security, health 
            care, criminal justice, transportation, and smart cities. There are numerous examples where AI already
             is making an impact on the world and augmenting human capabilities in significant ways.</p>
          <div class="content">
             <p>Meanwhile, a McKinsey Global Institute study of China found that “AI-led automation can give the Chinese 
                economy a productivity injection that would add 0.8 to 1.4 percentage points to GDP growth annually, 
                depending on the speed of adoption.”8 Although its authors found that China currently lags the United 
                States and the United Kingdom in AI deployment, the sheer size of its AI market gives that country 
                tremendous opportunities for pilot testing and future development.</p>

        <input type="checkbox" id="ch4"> 
        <h2>Policy, regulatory, and ethical issues</h2>
        <p>These examples from a variety of sectors demonstrate how AI is transforming many walks of 
            human existence. The increasing penetration of AI and autonomous devices into many aspects 
            of life is altering basic operations and decisionmaking within organizations, and improving
             efficiency and response times.</p>
          <div class="content">
             <p>At the same time, though, these developments raise important policy, regulatory, and 
                ethical issues. For example, how should we promote data access? How do we guard against
                 biased or unfair data used in algorithms? What types of ethical principles are introduced
                 
                 through software programming, and how transparent should designers be about their choices?
                  What about questions of legal liability in cases where algorithms cause harm?
                  The key to getting the most out of AI is having a “data-friendly ecosystem with unified standards 
                  and cross-platform sharing.” AI depends on data that can be analyzed in real time and brought
                   to bear on concrete problems. Having data that are “accessible for exploration” in the research
                    community is a prerequisite for successful AI development.
